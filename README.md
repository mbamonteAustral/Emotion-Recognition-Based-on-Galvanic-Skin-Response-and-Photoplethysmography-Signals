## Scripts (folder)

Each folder contains one specific experiment or simulation. To run the experiment, run the main.py file. 

Each folder contains:
* python scripts
* csv files contains the metrics yielded by each algortihm for each participant in the CASE dataset. 

Each folder contains the following python scripts:
* functions.py (Methods)
* definitions.py (Simulation definitions)
* processdataf.py (Train machine learning models and evaluate performance metrics for a particular participant)
* **main.py** (Main running file. Trains and evaluate performance metrics for all participants. Generate .csv files with results)
* show_csv_results.py (evaluate performance metrics for all participants. Need .csv files generated by main.py)

To run the simulation, run the main.py file. 



## Results (folder)

Contains figures summarizing the results. 

**show_global_results.py** plots the results. Each figure is build from data from specifics simulations folders, details in the scripts as comments.
