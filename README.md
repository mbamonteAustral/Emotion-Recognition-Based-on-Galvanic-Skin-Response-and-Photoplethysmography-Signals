##  CASE Dataset
CASE Dataset is made publicly available at https://gitlab.com/karan-shr/case_dataset.


## Scripts (folder)

Each folder contains one specific experiment or simulation. To run the experiment, execute the main.py file. 

Each folder contains:
* python scripts
* csv files contains the metrics yielded by each algortihm for each participant in the CASE dataset. 

Python scripts:
* functions.py (Methods)
* definitions.py (Simulation definitions)
* processdataf.py (Train machine learning models and evaluate performance metrics for a particular participant)
* **main.py** (Main running file. Trains and evaluate performance metrics for all participants. Generate .csv files with results)
* show_csv_results.py (evaluate performance metrics for all participants. Need .csv files generated by main.py)

To run the simulation, run the main.py file. 

To run the scripts, the CASE dataset should be downloaded first. Then, three subfolders should be located within the downloaded dataset folder:  

* physiological  (subfolder)
* annotations  (subfolder)
* case  (downloaded dataset folder, "case" name is only an example)

and replaced conveniently in the **processdataf.py** code:

    if platform == "linux" or platform == "linux2":

        physiological_base = r"/home/marcos/datasets/case/physiological/sub_"  # replace with current downloaded physiological folder
        annotation_base = r"/home/marcos/datasets/case/annotations/sub_" # replace with current downloaded annotation folder
        seqs_order_num_base = r"//home/marcos/datasets/case/seqs_"    # replace with current downloaded root folder
    elif platform == "win32":
        if socket.gethostname() == "LAPTOP-R7AHG17P":  # pc gamer (Javier)
            print("corriendo en PC gamer:")
            physiological_base = r"C:\Users\Javier\Desktop\CASE_full\CASE_full\data\interpolated\physiological\sub_" # replace with current physiological folder
            annotation_base = r"C:\Users\Javier\Desktop\CASE_full\CASE_full\data\\interpolated\annotations\sub_"  # replace with current downloaded annotation folder
            seqs_order_num_base = r"C:\Users\Javier\Desktop\CASE_full\CASE_full\metadata\seqs_"  # replace with current downloaded root folder
            # Set the default encoding
            sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')
        else:
            physiological_base = r"C:\Users\mbamo\Desktop\Datasets\CASE\interpolated\physiological\sub_"  # replace with current physiological folder
            annotation_base = r"C:\Users\mbamo\Desktop\Datasets\CASE\interpolated\annotations\sub_"  # replace with current downloaded annotation folder
            seqs_order_num_base = r"C:\Users\mbamo\Desktop\Datasets\CASE\metadata\seqs_"   # replace with current downloaded root folder



## Results (folder)

Contains figures summarizing the results. 

**show_global_results.py** plots the results. Each figure is build from data from specifics simulations folders, details in the scripts as comments.
