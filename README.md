##  CASE Dataset
CASE Dataset is made publicly available at https://gitlab.com/karan-shr/case_dataset.

## Scripts (folder)

Each folder contains one specific experiment or simulation. To run the experiment, execute the main.py file. 

Each folder contains:
* python scripts
* csv files contain the metrics yielded by each algorithm for each participant in the CASE dataset. 

Python scripts:
* functions.py (Methods)
* definitions.py (Simulation definitions)
* processdataf.py (Train machine learning models and evaluate performance metrics for a particular participant)
* **main.py** (Main running file. Trains and evaluates performance metrics for all participants. Generate .csv files with results)
* show_csv_results.py (evaluate performance metrics for all participants. Need .csv files generated by main.py)

Please refer to [requirements] (requirements.md)



To run the simulation, execute the main.py file. 

To run the scripts, the CASE dataset should be downloaded first. Suppose the downloaded folder is case_dataset. Then, three subfolders should be located within the downloaded dataset folder:  

* physiological  (relative path: case_dataset\data\interpolated\physiological)
* annotations  (relative path: case_dataset\data\interpolated\annotations)
* metadata (relative path: case_dataset\metadata)

These paths should then be replaced conveniently in the **processdataf.py** code::

    if platform == "linux" or platform == "linux2":

        physiological_base = r"/home/marcos/datasets/case/physiological/sub_"  # replace with current downloaded physiological folder
        annotation_base = r"/home/marcos/datasets/case/annotations/sub_" # replace with current downloaded annotation folder
        seqs_order_num_base = r"//home/marcos/datasets/case/seqs_"    # replace with current downloaded root folder
    elif platform == "win32":
        if socket.gethostname() == "LAPTOP-R7AHG17P":  # pc gamer (Javier)
            print("corriendo en PC gamer:")
            physiological_base = r"C:\Users\Javier\Desktop\CASE_full\CASE_full\data\interpolated\physiological\sub_" # replace with current physiological folder
            annotation_base = r"C:\Users\Javier\Desktop\CASE_full\CASE_full\data\\interpolated\annotations\sub_"  # replace with current downloaded annotation folder
            seqs_order_num_base = r"C:\Users\Javier\Desktop\CASE_full\CASE_full\metadata\seqs_"  # replace with current downloaded root folder
            # Set the default encoding
            sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')
        else:
            physiological_base = r"C:\Users\mbamo\Desktop\Datasets\CASE\interpolated\physiological\sub_"  # replace with current physiological folder
            annotation_base = r"C:\Users\mbamo\Desktop\Datasets\CASE\interpolated\annotations\sub_"  # replace with current downloaded annotation folder
            seqs_order_num_base = r"C:\Users\mbamo\Desktop\Datasets\CASE\metadata\seqs_"   # replace with current downloaded root folder



## Results (folder)

Contains figures summarizing the results. 

**show_global_results.py** plots the results. Each figure is built from data in specific simulation folders, as detailed in the script comments.
