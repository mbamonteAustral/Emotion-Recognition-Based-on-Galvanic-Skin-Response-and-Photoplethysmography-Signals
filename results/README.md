# Results folder

This folder contains two scripts:

* show_global_results.py
* main_calc.py

and figures. 

To obtain the figures, execute the show_global_results.py and main_calc.py files.

## show_global_results.py

It plots several figures from the paper, including labeling schemes, segment label mapping, mean accuracy for various window durations and overlap percentages, the performance of temporal-statistical vs. nonlinear features, the number of window instances for different window sizes and overlaps, the median label of two adjacent windows for different overlaps, and the number of points per class in the CASE dataset.

## main_calc.py

It plots the Mean Dominance ground truth label for various window durations and overlap percentages (see Figure 6 in the paper).
