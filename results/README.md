# Results folder

This folder contains two scripts:

* show_global_results.py
* main_calc.py

and figures. 

## show_global_results.py

It plots several figures contained in the paper, including labeling schemes, the segments labels mapping, the mean Accuracy performance for different window duration sizes and percentages of overlap, the performance of temporal-statistical vs. nonlinear features, the number of window instances for different window sizes and percentages of overlap, the median label of two adjacent windows for different overlap, and the number of points for each class in the CASE dataset.

## main_calc.py

It plots the Mean Dominance ground truth label for various window durations and overlap percentages (see Figure 6 in the paper).
